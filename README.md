# Lev website

This project was hosted on [Lev website](https://llavrov.github.io/project56/).

## Description to SPA website

- In the project I used basic technologies to create simple site functionality
- The site is written in `React` with the `redux` state-manager.
- The website was designed by myself using [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/EEYwRQuvvhaH2K26EpduCz/self-web?node-id=0%3A1).
- The site is fully responsive and takes into account most modern screen sizes
